Data Collection & Preparation:

Gather video data from multiple sources like CCTV footage, YouTube, or crime datasets​(anamoly part-1).
Extract frames from videos and preprocess them to target sizes (e.g., 64x224x224)​(anamoly part-1).
Label frames as normal or abnormal (e.g., fighting, vandalism) and organize them into training, validation, and test sets​(anamoly part-1)​(anamoly part -2).
Synthetic Data Generation with GANs:

Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using real data to create synthetic data and enhance the dataset's diversity​(anamoly part -2).
Ensure the discriminator can differentiate between real and synthetic data​(anamoly part -2).
Model Architecture & Training:

Use a model that combines Time Distributed ResNet50, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer​(anamoly part-1).
Compile the model with the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer, and include callbacks like early stopping​(anamoly part -2).
Train the model using a mix of real and synthetic frames​(anamoly part -2).
Performance Monitoring:

Monitor training progress using tools like TensorBoard to visualize validation loss and accuracy​(anamoly part -2).
Real-Time Testing:

Implement and test real-time detection using recorded or live feed video​(anamoly part -2).
